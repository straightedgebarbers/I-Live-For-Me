#Verse 1#
I’m reaching up

So don’t you dare give up

You can break it down

When the heart takes a hold

#Chorus#
So we’ve got to 
say the words
Before it hurts
You know it 
kills me anyway but 
I’ve gottta gotta day

#Verse 2#
I guess that’s another one we’ll sweep under the rug 
Just look at what we’ve become 
Everybody’s got a chance at starting over even if you think you don’t
