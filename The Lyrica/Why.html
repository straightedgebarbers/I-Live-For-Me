And I don’t struggle to explain 


#Verse 1#
Then you never could tell
All the lies that you sold me

#Chorus#
You used to make me feel 
like I’m one in a million
Like two against the world yeah we were champions 
We’re on the moon touching the stars in heaven 
But it ain’t true

#Bridge#
Now that sexin is easy
Loving is harder to get
Trade your man for a moment 
Tried so hard to forgive ya
